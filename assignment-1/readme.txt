This is my solution for assignment 1, an Elevator class, an ElevatorTest class, and 5 zoo animals.

They have been packaged up into a jar file that you can download and execute with the following command:

java -cp hw1.jar cscie55.hw1.elevatorTest.ElevatorTest

From the directory location of the jar file. This will allow you to see the output of my elevator test file.

If you have any problems executing the jar please email me at bjohnmurphy1984@gmail.com

Thanks, Brendan Murphy.
