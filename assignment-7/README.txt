This is my solution for Homework #7 - Adventures in Amazon`s EMR Problem 1. I had a few issues creating the jar files
correctly but was able to resolve them by following a few threads on Piazza. Apart from the packaging and dependencies
I did not run into too many other problems. The local jar file can be executed with the following command:

java -jar problem1-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar resources/mobydick.txt output_1

In order for this command to work, there must by a resources directory containing a mobydick.txt input file.

Other files included in this zip are:
Local Jar file: problem1-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
Remote Jar file: problem1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Local output: local-part-r-00000
Remote output: part-r-00000
Remote output: part-r-00001
Remote output: part-r-00002
